# Changelog

## 0.2.0

Rule parity with [@shadcn/lint](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/lint) 0.2.0.

- New rules: `no_restyle` (component contracts, variant and size suggestions,
  wrappers) and `no_unknown_classes` (asks the project's Tailwind v4 through
  Node or the standalone binary, with spelling suggestions).
- `require_static_classes` now checks design-system components only, and
  reports every unreadable part: socket assigns, unknown calls, glued
  interpolation.
- `no_raw_colors` reads `@theme` tokens (with resets and scoped namespaces),
  reports undeclared tokens with spelling corrections, and checks SVG color
  attributes.
- `no_arbitrary_values` names exact scale steps with the project's `--spacing`,
  the nearest font sizes and radii, and the nearest theme colors.
- `no_inline_styles` checks custom properties for hardcoded colors and reports
  unreadable style values; forwarding a received `style` is allowed.
- The shared policy engine: `allow`, `deny`, `contracts`, categories, class
  groups, patterns, and configuration errors for entries that match nothing.
- Custom messages with `{{placeholder|fallback}}`, and a shared `note`.
- The cn 0.3.2 class grammar, verified against the reference implementation.
- Components resolve through `import`, `alias` and `use MyAppWeb, :html`;
  `.heex` files through `embed_templates` and LiveView colocation.
- Configuration: explicit `rules` with a recommended default, file
  `overrides`, shared `settings`.
- Suggestions in JSON output, `mix heex_lint --fix`, and `heex-lint-disable`
  comments.

## 0.1.0

- First release: `no_raw_colors`, `no_arbitrary_values`, `no_inline_styles`,
